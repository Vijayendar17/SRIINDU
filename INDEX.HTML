            <h2>YOGA DAY</h2>
            <p>
                Yoga Day was observed on 21st June 2020. Yoga is India's ancient tradition and is more than just a physical activity; it's a spiritual discipline focusing on bringing harmony between mind and body. The word 'Yoga' derives from the Sanskrit root 'Yuj,' meaning 'to join' or 'to unite,' symbolizing the integration of one's whole being.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proven benefits of yoga include increased flexibility, fitness, mindfulness, and relaxation. Chairman Sri R. Venkat Rao encouraged everyone to celebrate International Yoga Day to become more active, make healthier choices, and follow lifestyle patterns that foster good health. The NSS Coordinator also explained the importance of yoga and demonstrated various postures to the students and staff.

                *Yoga is an invaluable gift of India’s ancient tradition, embodying unity of mind and body, thought and action, and a holistic approach to health and well-being.*
